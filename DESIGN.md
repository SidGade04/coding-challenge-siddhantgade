# Design Approach

## Getting Started
1. Ensure Node.js is installed (v14+ recommended)
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run: `node solution.js`
4. View the output with task results

## Approach
I implemented a functional programming approach using JavaScript's array methods (filter, map, reduce, sort) to process the event data. The solution is organized into clear tasks: color frequency counting by month, and referenced event analysis with value calculations and name lookups.

## Trade-offs
- **Readability vs Performance**: Used descriptive variable names and clear task separation for maintainability, though this creates more intermediate arrays
- **Error Handling**: Minimal error handling for simplicity - assumes data integrity and valid references
- **Memory Usage**: Multiple array transformations create temporary objects, but keeps the solution straightforward

## Next Steps
1. Add input validation and error handling for malformed data
2. Optimize performance for large datasets by reducing intermediate array creations
3. Add unit tests to verify edge cases (empty data, missing references)
4. Consider using a more robust data structure for reference lookups (Map instead of find())
5. Add configuration for the value threshold (currently hardcoded to 25)
